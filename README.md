## Camille Euvrard - 4th year of engineering school project

# Tchoutchou
Implementation of a little game for children.

# Rules of the games
The aim of this project is to create a maze for a small train. The train starts from the top left corner of the maze, and the child has to assemble the tracks to build a path to the exit. Once the child thinks having found the right path, he can press the small traffic light to make the train move. If the path is correct and the train reaches the exit (bottom right corner), he wins. If not, he has the choice to continue playing.  
There are 4 squares (or 9 squares for level 2). There are 3 squares with tracks, and one empty square. To move a rail the user must click on it, which will swap the rail square with the empty square.  
The user can configure the game with 2 levels of difficulty (maze 2x2 squares or 3x3) and can read the rules of the game.
If the user wins, there is a surprise.

# Tools
The project is implemented in C++, and we have created a graphical interface with Qt Creator.

# Reports
You can find the project's reports with my code files. There are three reports : 
* a developer's manual
* a user's manual
* a project's report
